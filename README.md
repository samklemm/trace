Purpose: In light of current affairs and the recent exposures of high profile sexual assault scandals, many women and even men have felt empowered and have been able to come forward with their own sexual assault stories. In response to this, we wanted to create a method to embolden even more women and men across the country to warn other women and men of their aggressors without having to testify against them in court or relive the event or even take legal action. Our website, trace, allows women and men to fill out a report against their aggressors with information like: first name, last name, description of the aggressor, description of the assualt, possibly location, and date of assualt.
